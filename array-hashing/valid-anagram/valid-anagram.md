Given two strings s and t, return True if t is an anagram of s, and False otherwise.
Explain your approach, the data structure you chose, and walk me through your reasoning and code

## Data Structure:
I use a fixed-size list of 26 integers to count character frequencies for lowercase letters.

## Strategy:
I first check if the lengths of the two strings differ.
If they do, they canâ€™t be anagrams.
If the lengths match, I create an array to count each character in s and subtract each character in t.
If all counts are zero, the strings are anagrams.

## Why this expression letter[ord(s[i]) - ord('s')]
I supposed the 26 integers list as the 26 english lowecase letters so that means that each element represent a letters a-z
if i'm iterating through nums and i found the character 's' which is the 19's letter in the classement
So by doing this calculation using ord (that takes the ASCII number of it) so ord('s') = 115 and ord('a') = 97 so the difference of them is 18 and because our letters list starts from 0 so that the letters[18] = s
So this is how  we found the specific element in the list


## Steps to Solve:

If len(s) != len(t), return False.

Initialize a count array of size 26 filled with zeroes.

Loop through both strings:

Increment count at the index for the character in s.

Decrement count at the index for the character in t.

At the end, check if all elements in the count array are 0.

If so, return True; otherwise, return False.

## Time Complexity: O(n)
I loop through the strings once (n is the length of s and t), and array operations are O(1).

## Space Complexity: O(1)
The count array has a fixed size of 26, regardless of input size.
