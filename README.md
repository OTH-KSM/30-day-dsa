Welcome to my 30 DAYS of DSA Challenge where i'll commit myself to solve problems each
You'll find the problems organized by topics followed the neetcode 250 structure
I'll try to give explanation of how i solved the problem the approach i used the steps i followed
and a extra information as data type preference , time and space complexity 

| Day | Topic                | Problem                 | Status        |  
|-----|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------|
